# LiveSplit.TotalGold

This component for [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.github.io) is designed to display the total amount of all Gold Splits achieved this run or this session -- in other words, by how much the Sum of Best has been reduced.

If you choose to track this by session, the tracked time will reset if you enter the Edit Splits menu.
